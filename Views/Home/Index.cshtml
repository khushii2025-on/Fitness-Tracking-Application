<h1 class="display-4">Fitness Tracking Application</h1>

<p class="lead">
    This application helps you record and review your workouts. Create workouts (date, title, total duration)
    and add multiple exercises to each workout (name, sets, reps, weight). Use the Workouts page
    to view history, and drill into each workout to manage its exercises.

<p>
    The application stores workouts and exercises in a SQL Server database and uses ASP.NET Identity
    for user authentication. Sign in to create and manage your training data.
